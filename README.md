# bart-chalkboard-api
An API built with a MEAN stack. Meant to contain everything Bart Simpson wrote on the chalkboard from the early seasons

Can be run locally (noder server.js) on **port 8000** and authorized mlab user account for the DB. More entries in the API coming soon.

Running an older version of mongodb which could use updating to 3+. See [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47662220/db-collection-is-not-a-function-when-using-mongoclient-v3-0?rq=1) when wanting to update.

Content will come from [this site](http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/lists/blackboard). I'll soon work on a way to mine it and post it into the API.
